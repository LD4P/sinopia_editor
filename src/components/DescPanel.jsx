    <h4>The underdrawing for the new world of linked data in libraries</h4>
    <p>Sinopia is a linked data creation environment where libraries can: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create metadata in a linked data environment without having to set up and maintain tools</li>
      <li>learn best practices related to linked data creation</li>
      <li>explore the idea of cooperative cataloging (linking to shared descriptions and identifiers) in a linked data environment</li>
      <li>contribute feedback and expertise to iterative development of tools for working in a linked data environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sinopia is developed by the <a href="http://www.ld4p.org">Linked Data for Production: Pathway to Implementation (LD4P2)</a> project, a collaboration among Cornell University, Harvard University, the Library of Congress, Stanford University, the School of Library and Information Science at the University of Iowa, and the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC).
    </p>
    <p>The term <i>sinopia</i> refers to &quot;The preliminary drawing for a fresco or mural, named for the reddish-brown pigment traditionally used to draw or transfer it.&quot; (<a href="http://www.lynnerutter.com/glossary.php#s">Glossary of Esoteric Architectural and Design Terms by Lynne Rutter</a>) LD4P&apos;s Sinopia is also a preliminary step, a sketch of what&apos;s possible, on the way to a full-fledged linked data production environment.
